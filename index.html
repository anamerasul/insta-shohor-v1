                                  JavaScript is a client-side scripting language and one of the most efficient, commonly used scripting languages. The term .client-side scripting language means that it runs at the client-side( or on the client machine) inside the web-browsers, To run JavaScript chrome browser using v8 engine, Firefox using Spidermonkey, Edge using Chakra and Safari using JavaScript Core. Now a days to run JavaScript on server-side  using Nodejs which is build on based on v8 engine and c++, To run JavaScript file on JavaScript engine and NodeJS every process are same,first JavaScript engine or NodeJS takes  the JavaScript file and converted into the machine code so that the JavaScript run. Then its execute the code line by line which is called Synchronous behavior by default It's does not execute a function or code before the previous process is finished. There is an asynchronous behavior on JavaScript, in this behavior JavaScript runs same as Synchronous but difference is if a function or code take more time to execute the JavaScript engine or NodeJS put the function or code into a queue ,after executing all code or function then executing the code or function which is on the queue.

                                What is the Difference Between Local Storage and Session Storage?

                                  <p><strong>Local Storage:</strong> This read-only interface property provides access to the Document’s native storage object, the hold on information is hold on across browser sessions.</p>
                                <p><strong>Session Storage:</strong> Session Storage objects may be accessed victimization the sessionStorage read-only property</p>
                                <p>
                                The Difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage information doesn't expire, whereas sessionStorage information is cleared once the page session ends.
                                The one major difference between localStorage and sessionStorage is that the expiration date.
                                localStorage persists the storage across browser sessions. therefore although the domain is opened in an exceedingly new tab, or the browser is closed and reopened, the storage is saved. there's no expiration.
                                sessionStorage is cleared once the page session ends. A page session lasts as long because the tab or the browser is open. Therefore, once you open a brand new tab or a brand new window, this creates a brand new session and new storage.</p>

                                        JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks.The JavaScript engine executes a script from the highest of the file and works its means down. It creates the execution contexts, pushes, and pops functions onto and off the decision stack within the execution section.If a operate takes an extended time to execute, you cannot act with the online browser throughout the function’s execution as a result of the page hangs. JS executes all operations on one thread, however employing a few good knowledge structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading. Let’s see what happens on the back-end.The call stack is responsible for keeping track of all the operations in line to be executed. Whenever a function is finished, it is popped from the stack.The event queue is responsible for sending new functions to the stack for processing.It follows the queue arrangement to keep up the proper sequence within which all operations ought to be sent for execution.Whenever an async function is called, it is sent to a browser API which built into the browser. Based on the command received from the call stack, the API starts its own single-threaded operation.The web browser also has other components, not just the JavaScript engine.When you call the setTimeout() function, make a fetch request, or click a button, the web browser can do these activities concurrently and asynchronously.
                                        The event loop could be a perpetually running method that monitors each the request queue and therefore the decision stack.If the decision stack isn't empty, the event loop waits till it's empty and places consecutive perform from the decision back queue to the call stack. If the request queue is empty, nothing can happen
